                  I'm currently the DS Tech Lead within the Privacy Products organization. My work spans various user-facing features such as the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/center/?entry_point=privacy_shortcuts_redirect">Meta Privacy Center</a>, <a href="https://accountscenter.facebook.com/info_and_permissions/dyi/?entry_point=download_your_information">Access & Download Your Information</a> tools, and the <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2022/05/metas-updated-privacy-policy/"> Meta Privacy Policy </a>. In this role, I've done the following:   
                  </p>

                  <ul class="disc">
                     <li>I've been responsible for key pieces of our measurement strategy, which includes developing ways to measure the prevalence of user privacy concerns, creating proxy metrics for user engagement and product findability, and conducting user analysis, all of which drive the overall product strategy of our 350+ team.</li>
                     <li>I created our organization's experimentation process, building a comprehensive data infrastructure and spearheading a standardized leadership review process that's supported more than 200+ experiments yearly across 50+ engineers.</li>
                     <li>I lead & coordinate the work of the data team of 4 data scientists and 3 data engineers, reviewing their work to provide technical feedback, and fostering collaboration with cross functional partners. I also mentor junior ICs on career growth, conflict resolution, and communication, both within my organization & as part of the broader data science community.</li>

                  <p>
                  I worked on the Community Products Integrity team, which was responsible for protecting people who used Facebook's Groups & Events products. My work encompassed various facets of integrity, including some of the following:
                  <ul class="disc">
                     <li>I developed novel detection methodology for identifying Groups & Events tied to politically motivated movements, such as Stop the Steal. During the election period, we were able to action on 1900+ entities proactively before they could be used to effectively organize and potentially create violence.</li>
                     <li>Partnering with engineering, I helped to improve the quality of our Groups recommendations engine by implementing a model calibration process that reduced impressions to harmful groups by 10% and saved ~5 months of engineering effort each half, and helped close gaps in our filter process that reduced civic misinformation impressions by 65%. </li>
                     <li>I worked on developing Moderation Alerts, a moderation tool for identify potential conflicts within communities through data analysis that increased retention by 10%. It's consistently ranked as #1 moderation feature amongst community partners.</li>
                  </ul>

                  I spent the summer of 2017 working at Meta (then Facebook) as a Data Science Intern on the Contacts Team within Growth Infastrucutre. My project involved leveraging terabytes of identity information collected from users across the various Meta owned entitites, such as Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.

                  <ul class="disc">
                     <li> I identified and engineered features for a model to classify business phone numbers, utilizing terabytes of addressbook data and contactpoint relationships. The model achieved a 98% F1 score (harmonic mean of precision and recall values) and we were issued a <a href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/10904175">patent</a> on "Verifying users of an electronic messaging system"</li>
                     <li>I uncovered significant data quality issues in essential data pipelines and worked with engineering teams to resolve client-side issues with collection that affected more than 46% of records. </li>
                     <li>I created pipelines and dashboards to monitor and better understand various stages of experiment lifecyle captured by internal experimentation tool, identifying areas of improve for internal tools development. </li>

                  I worked as a data science intern at Explorys, a healthcare startup that had recently been accquired by IBM Watson Health. This was a unique experience in the fact that it felt like working at a startup with the resources of a large company. I learned a lot that summer about being a data scientist, from learning how to write production quality code to working in a team of data scientists and engineers on common problems, and how to apply what I learned in school to learn problems.  During my time there, I worked on the following tasks:
                  </p>
                  <ul class="disc">
                     <li>I implemented a model to calculate heart disease risk using Java and MapReduce, with healthcare records stored in Hbase. This model informs healthcare providers about the risks facing more than 55 million U.S patients.</li>
                     <li>To improve our medical record standardization process, I designed and tested a new fuzzy string matching algorithm, which increased recall by 600% and precision by 50% when compared to exisiting methods.</li>
                     <li>I added new procedure revenue metrics to internal data quality reports, in order to better analyze revenue distributions from provider records.</li>
                     <li>I received commendation for clarity and impact when presenting my work to IBM executives during the summer finale event in Austin, Texas, location of Watson headquarters. </li>

                        <li>During the school year I led board of 10 members in charge of maintaining the day to day operations of the organization, as well as implementing several new intiatives.</li>
                        <li>I oversaw the creation and successful launch of our Finanical Innovation Challenge, a themed hackathon that brought together students, faculty, and financial institutions to come up with new ideas that could combat issues related to financial literacy (http://tepper.cmu.edu/news/2017-05-15-finnovation-challenge)</li>
                        <li>I co-developed our official website (www.moneythinkcmu.org) as an informational and recruitment tool. </li>

                  For two years in college I was an RA both for under & upperclassmen.

                  <li>I received training in conflict resolution, identifying problematic behavior and first responder training.</li>
                  <li>I organized and ran dorm-wide events such as group outings, socials, and discussion groups. I was particularly interested in current events and politics, and so I took initative by organizing events around presidential debates, major news stories, and educating residents on local Pittsburgh politics.</li>

                  <h3>Carnegie Mellon Computer Science Department</h3>
                  <p class="info">Teaching Assistant<span>&bull;</span> <em class="date">Jan 2018 – Present</em></p>

                  <p>
                  In Spring 2018, I was a TA for 15-112, Carnegie Mellon's famed introductory computer science class. 
                  <ul class="disc">
                  <li>Each week I held a recitation for a class of 30 students, reviewing that week's material and/or introducing next week's material, clarifying confusing concepts and going over practice problems. </li>
                  <li>In addition, I also held weekly office hours to answer questions on course materials and the weekly homework, as well as helping lead review sessions to large groups of students around exam time.</li>
                  <li>What I'm most proud of is taking initiative to conduct quantitative analysis on the structure of the course and practices. After collecting student level data on assignment scores, quiz performance, attendance, and self-reported time spent reports, I generated a series of recommendations to the professors of the course, helping to pinpoint relationships between time spent and particular concepts as well as effectiveness of review materials in terms of student results. This was the first time a rigourous review of teaching practices had occured, and led to many common assumptions being revisited.  </li>
                  </ul>

                  In Spring 2017, I TAed a new course in the Economics Department, 73-160 Foundations of Microeconomics: Applications and Theory. 
                  <ul class="disc">
                  <li>Each week I held a recitation for a class of 20 students, reviewing that week's material and/or introducing next week's material, clarifying confusing concepts and going over practice problems.</li>
                  <li>I also held weekly office hours to answer questions on course materials and the weekly homework.</li>
                  <li>Because this was the first time the course was being offered, I constantly took feedback on the course content and relayed it to the department to improve future iterations of the course.</li>

I created an interactive tool to help visualize the ticketing and donor data using R Shiny and graphs made with ggplot. It was my first time using either, and a really great learning experience working as consultants for this organization.</p>

MediMinder used natural language processing and a secure database backend to remind kids about when to take their medication, match side effects to their cause, and notify parents of missed times or adverse reactions. Our team of undergrads placed 4th amongst all competitng teams across the country.</p>
